<h1 align="center" id="title">Bitez Food App</h1>

<p id="description">Bitez is a FullStack application. I wanted to create a food app that could display multiple food offerings, give the option to add various products to your shopping cart, remove them but also be able to pay for them. The user is also able to filter by categories of food.</p>
